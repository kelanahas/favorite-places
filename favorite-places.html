       <div class="column">
       <h2>Koh Lipe, Thailand</h2> 
       <p>Koh Lipe is a very small island in southern Thailand about 100 km south of Koh Lanta. Lipe is pure magic! Never in my life have I seen beaches with water so clear and blue. Every fruit and vegetable that grows on the island is seemingly 100 times more succulent and flavorful than grown any place else. </p>

       <h2>Melbourne, Australia</h2>
       <p>I lived in Melbourne for 2 years when I was younger and have only wanted to go back ever since! Melbourne as I remember it is an epicenter of all things culture. The city is beautiful, and the food is out of this world.</p>

       <h2>Chiang Mai, Thailand</h2>
       <p>Chiang Mai is one of the ancient cities in Thailand. The downtown area or the "old city" is surrounded by an almost 800 year old mote and stone wall. Chiang Mai is also called the city of temples...there seems to be a gorgeous temple on every block! It's one of the only places where I've seen an 800 year old stupa right next to a 7/11. </p>
